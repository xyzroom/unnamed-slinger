# V1-test summary

First iteration summary:
- Basic toolhead (no part cooling)
- Basic Y axis (no motor cooling)

Issues:
- Skipping steps on Y. Either binding due to thermal expansion with the 2 linear rails, or motors running too hot
- Inconsistent sensorless homing on X/Y due to significant temperature range

Parts to redesign for V2:
- Y axis motor cooling
- Part cooling
- Endstops on X and Y
